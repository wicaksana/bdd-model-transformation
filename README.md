## Introduction

Behavior-driven development (BDD) is a software development process which uses stories from users as the base of the development. A story is a descriptive narration explaining about the desired behavior of the software being developed for certain scenarios. 

This assignment is intended to develop tools to support BDD software development. From userâ€™s stories, the tools will generate relevant source code in a certain programming language. In this case, Java. First, we develop the metamodel of BDD. Next, we perform model transformation from BDD model to a simplified programming language (we use Java as our reference). Finally, we implement code generation based on the output of preceding model transformation.

We use [jBehave](http://jbehave.org/) as our reference of BDD. This project is developed using Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).
